        Who creates Polyglot Kids?
    </h1>
    <p class="text-start text-sm max-w-3xl mx-auto mb-6 leading-relaxed">
        Polyglot Kids is an English language school that was created out of a passion for teaching, a need for
        development, and authentic contact with children and young people. School branches throughout Poland are created
        by people who hold these values close.
        <br />
        We cooperate with franchisees who create a space friendly for children's development. Our methodologists support
        teachers in improving their work and create ambitious educational materials. Teachers with passion, commitment
        and empathy conduct classes, focusing on authentic contact with students. We invite parents who care about the
        comprehensive development of their children, but above all children, whose colorful world drives us to action.

            How did Polyglot Kids come about?
        </h1>
        <p class="text-sm md:text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
            It all started in Warsaw’s Mokotów district, in a grey, inconspicuous building, where Joanna Zarańska
            founded a language school, one of the first in Poland specializing in teaching English to children. After a
            few weeks, it turned out that the appearance of the building had nothing to do with what was happening
            inside. The classes were interesting, cheerful and colorful. Joanna’s enthusiasm combined with her own
            program implemented during the course gave amazing results. The young students talked about the lessons as
            if they were real adventures, full of puzzles, songs, rhymes and movement, increasingly using English words.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm md:text-base leading-relaxed">
            It was 1993, a supernova had just been discovered in the constellation of the Great Bear, and the Early
            Stage language school debuted in a small Warsaw housing e state, innovative in terms of teaching methods,
            opening children to the world, born under a lucky star.

            </h1>
            <p class="text-sm md:text-base text-gray-900 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                It soon became clear that the school needed new people. But not ordinary English teachers, but
                passionate, creative, cheerful teachers who loved working with children and ambitious challenges. This
                is how Joanna's daughters joined the team: first Agnieszka, now known by her stage name Aga Zaryan, and
                after a few years Tonia, who currently manages the entire Polyglot Kids company together with her
                husband
                Adam. For many years, the school operated as a small family business, gaining popularity and a wider
                group of new students year by year.
            </p>
            <p class="text-sm md:text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed">
                In 1997, it was time for a change. Joanna, at the urging of one of her parents, opened another branch of
                the school, in Ursynów. At Agnieszka's initiative, a branch was established in Warsaw's Ochota district.
                This is how Polyglot Kids's journey ar ound the capital began. Today, our schools operate throughout
                Poland.

            <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Our own textbooks, several years of experience, hundreds of ideas for interesting classes and enthusiasm
                were the potential with which the school entered the new millennium. The New Year's Eve countdown began,
                and with it the dynamic development of the company. Talented people joined the teaching staff, new
                projects and branches were created. In 2005, Polyglot Kids was awarded the European Language Label for
                innovation in teaching a foreign language for the first time. In the years 2007-2011, the school went
                beyond the borders of Warsaw, appearing in the largest Polish cities. Currently, it operates in over 850
                locations, teaching over 58,000 children.
            </p>
            <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed">
                Apart from numerous awards and educational successes, the greatest reason for pride are the young
                graduates of the school, leaving its walls with an excellent knowledge of English. Their openness to the
                world and wide development prospects are the best motivation for further work. Since the beginning of
                the school, children have inspired us the most.
