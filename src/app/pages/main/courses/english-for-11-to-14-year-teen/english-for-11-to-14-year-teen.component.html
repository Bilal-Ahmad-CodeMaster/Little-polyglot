Our teenage students are chatty â€“ and in English! The topics covered in Polyglot Kids classes encourage them to think critically, express their own opinions and solve problems creatively. In English classes for 11-14 year olds, we familiarise students with exam situations, making
<strong>the eighth grade exam and Cambridge exams at A2 Flyers, A2 Key, B1 Preliminary levels a piece of cake!</strong>

            <p class="text-gray-700">
                English courses for teenagers aged 11â€“14 are a continuation of the earlier stages of education. Their
                intensive program and ambitious materials develop students' ability to communicate fluently in English.
                In addition, with the involvement of our 12 superpowers, they comprehensively prepare for
                <strong> Cambridge exams at the following levels: Movers, Flyers, Key for Schools, Preliminary for
                    Schools.</strong>
                <br><br>
                We believe that every English course for teenagers is an investment in their future. At this stage of
                language education, our students successfully
                <strong> pass the eighth-grade exam, and by the end of primary school, they achieve a level of English
                    equivalent to the basic matriculation exam.</strong>
                <br><br>
                Thanks to a well-planned student path, everyone at Polyglot Kids can achieve success, not only in exams!

                As our students have discovered,
                <strong> Polyglot Kids English for Teens is more than just learning.</strong>
                Students in this age group increasingly take the lead, work in pairs, groups and small teams. This gives
                them many opportunities to actively use language with their peers. Working on different challenges, they
                learn to think critically and express their opinions, as well as listen empathetically and solve
                problems together. These are essential skills for the future!
