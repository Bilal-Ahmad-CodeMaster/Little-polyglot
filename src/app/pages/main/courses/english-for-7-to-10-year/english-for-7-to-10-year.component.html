        <div class="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-xl shadow">
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">English for 7-10 year olds – learning and having fun!</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700">
                <strong>English courses for children aged 7–10 at Polyglot Kids are full of humor, movement, and
                    music,</strong>
                which we use in our teaching method. We encourage children to speak English freely in a fun and relaxed
                atmosphere provided by our creative teachers. We expand students' vocabulary, develop their ability to
                listen and read their first texts in English. We accustom them to making mistakes so that they do not
                block the joy of learning.
                <br><br>
                <strong>At this stage, we prepare children for their first Cambridge exams: Pre-A1 Starters, A1
                    Movers.</strong>
                And we help them pass them relaxed and without stress. English for 7-year-olds and slightly older
                children at Polyglot Kids is an excellent investment in the future.
                <br><br>
                <strong>English for 7-year-olds at Polyglot Kids is based on an intensive curriculum,</strong>
                which assumes mastering a rich vocabulary and communication skills in English. From the very beginning,
                7-year-olds are encouraged to speak to the teacher and to each other in English, thanks to which they
                subconsciously absorb language structures and understand even complex messages.
                <br><br>
                Thanks to our 12 superpowers, all classes are interesting and maximally engaging. Thanks to the safe
                atmosphere, teacher support and exciting activities,
                <strong>students are not afraid to experiment with the language, they quickly become bold and create
                    their own statements,</strong>
                treating English as a natural tool of communication. During our English lessons for 7-, 8-, 9- and
                10-year-olds, it is sometimes hard to believe that this is learning! Students have great fun and at the
                same time gain valuable knowledge.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Box 4: 7–10 year olds - Group Information -->
        <div class="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-xl shadow">
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">English classes for children aged 7–10</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700">
                English classes for 7-, 8-, 9- or 10-year-olds, just like other children, are held in groups that are
                precisely matched in terms of age and language proficiency level. How do we do it?
                <br><br>
                To determine the English language level of 8-year-olds and older children, we organize an individual
                meeting with the school's methodologist before the start of classes. At such a meeting, the child
                completes a placement test and talks to the methodologist, which allows us to determine the language
                level of the future student.
                <strong>Thanks to this, children learn in groups with a matched level.</strong>
                <br><br>
                Groups in English classes at Polyglot Kids allow for the appropriate dynamics of work and possible
                additions to their composition. Each new person can join only after a detailed check of the level of
                English proficiency. Thanks to this, the list of students is not subject to frequent modifications,
                which guarantees an even level and ensures progress in learning English for the entire group.
                <strong>We cordially invite all children aged 7, 8, 9 and 10 to English classes!</strong>
