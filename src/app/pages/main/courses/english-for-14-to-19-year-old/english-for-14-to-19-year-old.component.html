                English for teenagers at Polyglot Kids is an important investment in your teenager's future. Secondary
                school
                is a real challenge for teenagers and a time of first serious decisions. Fluent English is their chance
                for
                international friendships, academic success, scholarships, and hobbies.
                <br><br>
                Our program and the 12 Superpowers method help teenagers get used to exam situations and freely express
                their thoughts in English. Thanks to this, they not only pass key language exams with ease, but also
                develop
                the ability to work in a group, be proactive, and think critically.

                Why are English lessons for teenagers at Polyglot Kids so effective? Because we treat our students as
                partners –
                we give them the opportunity to express themselves creatively, engage them in class and support them in
                building
                autonomy. We know that making mistakes is part of the learning process, so we teach teenagers to be open
                to
                their own mistakes and the mistakes of others. Thanks to this, we have a relaxed, friendly atmosphere
                that
                teenagers really need.
                <br><br>
                During English lessons at Polyglot Kids, teenagers aged 15-19 receive ambitious challenges, learn active
                cooperation in a group, and leadership behavior. Thanks to this, they acquire competences that allow
                them
                to take life into their own hands. Solid linguistic and non-linguistic preparation gives Polyglot Kids
                students
                a pass to travel, study, and work freely.

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">English classes in Polyglot Kids for 15-19 year olds</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700">
                English classes at Polyglot Kids are designed specifically for teenagers aged 15-19. These classes
                provide
                a
                tailored, engaging environment for language learning, encouraging students to actively participate in
                group
                discussions and individual assignments. The 12 Superpowers method is fully integrated into the
                curriculum,
                allowing students to develop not only their English skills but also their critical thinking and
                leadership
                abilities.
                <br><br>
                We also place a strong emphasis on helping students build confidence and comfort in their language
                abilities,
                which prepares them for major exams. Our approach fosters an environment where students feel comfortable
                making
                mistakes and growing through them.
                <br><br>
                For new students, we organize individual leveling meetings with the methodologist to ensure groups are
                appropriately matched in terms of language level. This helps in creating stable, cohesive groups that
                contribute to a better learning environment.
